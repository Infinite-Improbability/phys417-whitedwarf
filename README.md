# Setup
Clone the repo and open Julia's REPL from inside it. Then switch to the package manager and run
```
activate .
instantiate
```
to load the environment and install required packages.

Or use the Binder link above. Be warned - it may be slow if it has to build the environment. You can also view on NBViewer if you don't mind the loss of interactivity.
